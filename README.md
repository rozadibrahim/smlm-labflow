# SMLM LabFlow

A modular pipeline wrapper for **Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM)** analysis.

It handles the engineering overhead — QC, calibration, training, inference, export, benchmarking, and reporting — so you can focus on the science.

> **Status:** active — ~50 methods across 13 stages; 24 run in-core out of the box  
> **Install:** [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) — conda / pixi / napari (lab users) **or** pip / CLI / HPC (developers)  
> **Architecture:** registry-driven — one [`config/methods.yaml`](config/methods.yaml) drives the CLI **and** Snakemake + Nextflow

### Try it in 30 seconds (no microscope data)

```bash
pip install -e ".[light]"      # or, when published:  mamba install -c conda-forge smlm-labflow
labflow demo                   # synthetic end-to-end: drift -> cluster -> counting -> stats -> metrics -> render -> track -> analyze
labflow conformance            # shows which methods actually run on your machine
labflow list                   # every method, grouped by stage
```

Biologists can instead use the **napari plugin** (Plugins → *Open LabFlow run*) or a locked
**pixi** environment — see [docs/install.md](docs/install.md). Heavy tools install on demand
(`labflow install cellpose`) as isolated, prebuilt images.

## What it does

A typical SMLM run has many fragile manual steps. LabFlow wraps them into a single reproducible CLI:

```
calibrate → train → infer → QC → export → benchmark → report
```

---

## Quick start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
conda env create -f env_yamls/liteloc_env_base.yml
conda activate liteloc_env
```

### 2. Configure your machine

Edit `adapters/backend_paths.yml` to point at your local LiteLoc install:

```yaml
liteloc:
  root: /path/to/LiteLoc
```

### 3. Choose a profile

Copy and adapt `profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml` for your microscope setup.

### 4. Run the pipeline

```bash
# Step 1 — calibrate PSF from bead z-stack
python run_pipeline.py calibrate \
  -i /data/beads \
  -p profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml \
  -o outputs/my_calibration \
  -b liteloc

# Step 2 — train localization model
python run_pipeline.py train \
  -i /data/training_frames \
  -p profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml \
  -o outputs/my_training \
  -b liteloc

# Step 3 — run inference
python run_pipeline.py infer \
  -i /data/raw_movies \
  -p profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml \
  -o outputs/my_inference \
  -b liteloc
```

## Configuration: two files, two roles

| File | What goes in it |
|---|---|
| `adapters/backend_paths.yml` | **Where** software is installed on your machine |
| `profiles/*.yaml` | **What** scientific workflow to run (PSF type, pixel size, etc.) |

These are intentionally separate so that the same profile works on any machine that has the backend installed.

---

## Profiles

Profiles define the scientific configuration for a run:

- PSF type and dimensionality
- Calibration mode
- Pixel size and z-step
- LiteLoc YAML sections (calibration / training / inference)
- Export and QC options

Start from `profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml` — it uses `auto` placeholders for paths that LabFlow fills at runtime (bead file, model path, movie paths).

You can extend it for your specific setup:

```yaml
extends: liteloc_unified_example.yaml
profile_name: my_lab_condition_A

microscope:
  pixel_size_nm: 100

calibration:
  z_step_nm: 50
```

---

## Outputs

Each run creates a structured folder:

```
outputs/my_run/
├── results/
│   └── batches/<movie_id>/
│       ├── input_qc.json
│       ├── input_preview.png
│       ├── canonical_localizations.csv
│       ├── smap_localizations.csv
│       ├── picasso_localizations.csv
│       ├── napari_points.csv
│       └── locan_localizations.csv
├── benchmarks/
│   ├── runtime_benchmark.csv
│   ├── quality_metrics_benchmark.csv
│   └── comparison_ready_summary.csv
├── reports/
│   ├── run_report.md
│   └── run_report.html
└── registry/
    └── resolved_runtime_config.json
```

---

## Combining and comparing runs

```bash
# Merge outputs from multiple runs
python combine_run_outputs.py

# Compare benchmarks across runs
python combine_benchmark_comparisons.py results -o comparison_summary_all_runs.csv
```

## Unified pipeline & CLI (`labflow`)

The pipeline is a chain of stages — `localize → drift → segment → track →
cluster → spatial_stats → counting → phenotype → analyze → qc_audit → report` —
where every method is declared once in **`config/methods.yaml`**. One registry
drives both the **`labflow` CLI** and the **Snakemake pipeline**, so adding a
method is a single YAML entry that appears in both. Each method runs in the
environment it needs (`python` in-process, or an isolated `venv`/`conda`/`docker`)
over a canonical CSV file contract, so conflicting tools (LiteLoc/torch,
MAGIK/TensorFlow, Julia AIM, Fiji, MATLAB) coexist cleanly.

```bash
# isolated core env (keeps labflow's deps off your system Python)
python -m venv envs/labflow && envs/labflow/Scripts/pip install -e ".[light]"

labflow list                                       # every method, grouped by stage
labflow run drift -b aim_julia -i locs.csv -o out/corrected.csv   # -b selects the backend
labflow run cluster -b dbscan  --gui -i locs.csv   # --gui: open the backend's GUI
labflow review outputs/.../results --with napari   # inspect a run in napari
labflow pipeline --cores 4 --config cluster=true spatial_stats=true
```

Backends run now (in-process): `drift` (none/rcc/aim_julia/dme), `cluster`
(dbscan/optics/hdbscan), `spatial_stats` (ripley/paircorrelation/nnd/voronoi),
`track` (trackpy). The rest (DECODE, FD-DeepLoc, Cellpose, StarDist, MAGIK, MIRO,
DeepTRACE, TrackMate, ClusterNet, qPAINT, …) are registered and wired, `ready`
once their environment is built. See [docs/methods.md](docs/methods.md) (add a
method), [docs/environments.md](docs/environments.md) (per-tool envs), and
[docs/snakemake_backends.md](docs/snakemake_backends.md) (drift internals).

## Roadmap

- Additional backend adapters (DECODE, DeepSTORM, FD-DeepLoc)
- CRLB/RMSE reporting improvements
- PSF diagnostics
- Grid artifact analysis
- Profile templates for common SMLM setups
- Notebook-based demos
- Registry compatibility checks

---

## Limitations

- LiteLoc must be installed separately
- Profiles and backend YAMLs must match your microscope and PSF setup
- Some QC metrics are experimental
- Scientific validation is the responsibility of the user
