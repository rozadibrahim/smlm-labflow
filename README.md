# SMLM LabFlow

A modular pipeline wrapper for **Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM)** analysis.

It handles the engineering overhead — QC, calibration, training, inference, export, benchmarking, and reporting — so you can focus on the science.

> **Status:** research prototype — development paused (13 September 2026)  
> **Current backend:** LiteLoc  
> **Architecture:** backend-agnostic (DECODE, DeepSTORM, FD-DeepLoc adapters can be added)

## Development checkpoint — 13 September 2026

Active development is paused. The current code, environment files, configuration examples, and roadmap are preserved for future work. There is no scheduled date for resuming development.

This checkpoint documents the existing software; it does not establish a newly tested or scientifically validated release. The features below describe the current implementation, with setup requirements and limitations noted in this README.

### Resuming development

1. Recreate the environment using the quick start below and install LiteLoc separately.
2. Review `adapters/backend_paths.example.yml` and adapt `adapters/backend_paths.yml` to the local LiteLoc installation.
3. Adapt a profile to the microscope, PSF, calibration data, and movie paths.
4. Run a small representative calibration/training/inference workflow and inspect the QC, exported localizations, and reports.
5. Record the backend revision, environment, dataset, configuration, and measured results before extending the pipeline. Revisit the deferred roadmap after this validation.

## What it does

A typical SMLM run has many fragile manual steps. LabFlow wraps them into a single reproducible CLI:

```
calibrate → train → infer → QC → export → benchmark → report
```

---

## Quick start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
conda env create -f env_yamls/liteloc_env_base.yml
conda activate liteloc_env
```

### 2. Configure your machine

Install LiteLoc separately. Use `adapters/backend_paths.example.yml` as a template and edit `adapters/backend_paths.yml` to point at your local installation:

```yaml
liteloc:
  root: /path/to/LiteLoc
```

### 3. Choose a profile

Copy and adapt `profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml` for your microscope setup.

### 4. Run the pipeline

```bash
# Step 1 — calibrate PSF from bead z-stack
python run_pipeline.py calibrate \
  -i /data/beads \
  -p profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml \
  -o outputs/my_calibration \
  -b liteloc

# Step 2 — train localization model
python run_pipeline.py train \
  -i /data/training_frames \
  -p profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml \
  -o outputs/my_training \
  -b liteloc

# Step 3 — run inference
python run_pipeline.py infer \
  -i /data/raw_movies \
  -p profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml \
  -o outputs/my_inference \
  -b liteloc
```

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Input QC | Shape, dtype, axes, intensity stats, preview image, histogram |
| Calibration | `vector_beads`, `spline_file`, `analytic`, or `none` |
| Backend execution | Adapter-based: add new backends without touching the core |
| Canonical output | Unified localization CSV across all backends |
| Export formats | SMAP, Picasso, napari, Locan |
| Benchmarking | Runtime, memory, resolution, drift, CRLB/RMSE metrics |
| Reports | Markdown + HTML run reports |
| Registry | Tracks latest calibration/model/results for reuse across runs |
| Review helper | Separate napari/Locan viewer (`napari_locan_review.py`) |

## Configuration: two files, two roles

| File | What goes in it |
|---|---|
| `adapters/backend_paths.yml` | **Where** software is installed on your machine |
| `profiles/*.yaml` | **What** scientific workflow to run (PSF type, pixel size, etc.) |

These are intentionally separate so that the same profile works on any machine that has the backend installed.

---

## Profiles

Profiles define the scientific configuration for a run:

- PSF type and dimensionality
- Calibration mode
- Pixel size and z-step
- LiteLoc YAML sections (calibration / training / inference)
- Export and QC options

Start from `profiles/liteloc_unified_example.yaml` — it uses `auto` placeholders for paths that LabFlow fills at runtime (bead file, model path, movie paths).

You can extend it for your specific setup:

```yaml
extends: liteloc_unified_example.yaml
profile_name: my_lab_condition_A

microscope:
  pixel_size_nm: 100

calibration:
  z_step_nm: 50
```

---

## Outputs

Each run creates a structured folder:

```
outputs/my_run/
├── results/
│   └── batches/<movie_id>/
│       ├── input_qc.json
│       ├── input_preview.png
│       ├── canonical_localizations.csv
│       ├── smap_localizations.csv
│       ├── picasso_localizations.csv
│       ├── napari_points.csv
│       └── locan_localizations.csv
├── benchmarks/
│   ├── runtime_benchmark.csv
│   ├── quality_metrics_benchmark.csv
│   └── comparison_ready_summary.csv
├── reports/
│   ├── run_report.md
│   └── run_report.html
└── registry/
    └── resolved_runtime_config.json
```

---

## Combining and comparing runs

```bash
# Merge outputs from multiple runs
python combine_run_outputs.py

# Compare benchmarks across runs
python combine_benchmark_comparisons.py results -o comparison_summary_all_runs.csv
```

---


## Roadmap

Deferred while development is paused; these items have no delivery schedule.

- Additional backend adapters (DECODE, DeepSTORM, FD-DeepLoc)
- CRLB/RMSE reporting improvements
- PSF diagnostics
- Grid artifact analysis
- Profile templates for common SMLM setups
- Notebook-based demos
- Registry compatibility checks

---

## Limitations

- LiteLoc must be installed separately
- Profiles and backend YAMLs must match your microscope and PSF setup
- Some QC metrics are experimental
- Scientific validation is the responsibility of the user
